// This view (DirectoryExplorerView.tsx) has been removed and replaced by FilesView.tsx
// to align with the full application specification provided by the user, which
// includes multiple views and more complex functionality.
// The FilesView.tsx now serves as the primary interface for file system interaction,
// export, ruleset application, and macro execution.
